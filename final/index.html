               <p>On February 22nd, 2024, Netflix released the first season of their live-action re-imagining of the 2005 hit animated series, Avatar: The Last Airbender. The animated series first season was 20 episodes; this live-action adaptation condensed it into eight episodes. Certain storylines were added, others removed, and some were finally combined together. The show was a landmark in ethnic representation, and also used cutting edge visual effects. </p>
               <p>When taking on the showrunner role, Albert Kim made it clear he wanted the cast to reflect the cultures they were inspired by. This meant finding indigenous actors for the Water Tribe and Asian actors for the Earth Kingdom, Air Nomads, and Fire Nation. </p>
               <p>“We were committed to making sure our casting was culturally, ethnically appropriate," Kim said to EW. "So we [had an] all Asian or Indigenous cast in our show.”</p>
               <p>Unlike the new adaptation, the original show featured majority white voice actors. 15 voice actors appeared in over 10 episodes of the original 61 episodes and yet only three were not white. This is without considering the number of roles each voice actor portrayed.</p>
               <p>Only one actor from the original series reprised his role. James Sie returned to portray the Cabbage Merchant as he was one of the few actors of Chinese origin in the original voice cast. Daniel Dae Kim was a voice actor in the original show and returned to the live-action adaptation but in a different role. In the animated show, he voiced General Fong in one episode whereas in Netflix’s Avatar he starred as Fire Lord Ozai, previously voiced by Mark Hamill. </p>

               <!--Yay Juxtapose but this was hard to figure out the height thing-->
               <p>According to the 2023 UCLA Hollywood Diversity Report, only 36% of lead actors were minorities. The US population at the same time was 43% minorities. Netflix’s Avatar is likely the first US produced show to have zero white actors.</p>

               <p>While there are no other American shows with zero white actors, there are other shows with predominantly Asian casts. Fresh Off The Boat ran from 2015 to 2020 with an almost all-Asian starring cast. Of the eight lead roles, six were of Chinese origin and only two were white. This show ran for six seasons as it explored an immigrant Chinese family living in the United States. </p>
               <p>Another show with a majority Asian cast is Never Have I Ever. This show explores an Indian-American high school girl, Devi, living in the United States. This show has seven actors in starring roles, and two were white. </p>
               <p>One of 2024’s biggest shows is FX’s Shōgun. The show is about an English sailor, John Blackthorne portrayed by Cosmo Jarvis, who ends up shipwrecked in 16th century Japan. Because the show is set in Japan, besides the shipwrecked characters, everyone else is Asian. In fact, the Asian part of the cast is all Japanese ensuring authentic representation.</p>

               <p>It’s important to remember how much progress has been made by reflecting on the past. David Fincher’s 2010 film The Social Network is widely regarded as one of the best films of all time. One of the main characters, Divya Narendra, is even Indian! Yet, he is not portrayed by an Indian. He is portrayed by actor Max Minghella whose father is Italian and mother is a mix of Chinese, Jewish, Parsi, Irish, and Swedish heritage. </p>
               <p>Other examples include Scarlett Johannsen, a white actress, who starred in an adaptation of Japanese anime Ghost in the Shell in 2017. 2016’s Doctor Strange had Tilda Swinton, a white actress, portraying the Ancient One, a Tibetian character. Kevin Feige, head of Marvel Studios, later acknowledged it was a mistake in an interview with Men’s Health.</p>
               <p>“We’re not going to do the cliché of the wizened, old, wise Asian man. But it was a wake-up call to say, ‘Well, wait a minute, is there any other way to figure it out? Is there any other way to both not fall into the cliché and cast an Asian actor?’ And the answer to that, of course, is yes,” said Feige.</p>
               <p>Having white actors present in a show does not mean it is taking a step back for representation. What matters is authentically casting actors to make sure they are representing who the characters are. There is nothing wrong with Shōgun including white actors; that is the fundamental premise of the show. Netflix’s Avatar ensured the actors were from the cultures they represented and the show was uncompromising in this. As long as that focus remains, representation will be achieved. </p>
